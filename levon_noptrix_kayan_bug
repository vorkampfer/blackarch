If you have ever encountered the "Levon noptrix kayan bug" then this may help you fix it. 
This bug is so old yet it still has not been fixed. I am not sure what causes the bug. It is 
either a bad timezone or a corrupt mirrorlist. Here are the steps to fix it. This is for 
educational purposes. If you break your machine it is not my fault. I would classify this 
an easy fix once the issue is understood.

### Delete any corruptions.
1. Fix your time
2. # timectl set-ntp true
3. Delete all the corrupted keys or mirrorlists. Yes I said delete all your mirrorlists.
4. sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist (also blackarch-mirrorlist and mirrorlist.pacnew as well)
5. sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/hooks/*
6. sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/scripts/*
4. sudo rm -rf ~/.gnupg
5. sudo rm -rf ~/etc/pacman.d/gnupg/ (Delete everything in the directory even the gnupg/ folder itself if possible)
6. sudo rm -rf /var/lib/pacman/sync/blackarch.db.sig (I also recommend just deleting everything inside the sync folder)
7. sudo rm -rf /var/lib/pacman/sync/* (Optional but if your issue is persistant delete everything in the sync folder)
### Create your own MirrorList
8. Now you need to create a custom mirrorlist. (https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist) This is an important step because this "bug" will keep pointing to the wrong mirrors
so it is highley recommended  you create your own custom mirror list. See the links below to create your own arch and or blackarch mirror list.
9. Once you create your custom mirror list clean it
10. $ sed -i "s/#Serv/Serv" mirrorlist (Your just replacing #Serv with Serve to remove the hashtag from the word server)
11. Save it to /etc/pacmand.d/mirrorlist (You will want servers that are in your country. That is up to you but if you really want this bug to go away then I 
advise just using servers in your own country.)
12. Do the same thing for the blackarch-mirrorlist, but I do not think they have a custom mirrorlist generator like arch does. There is this package called reflector.
You can look into that further at https://joshtronic.com/automatically-update-arch-linux-mirrors/
13. Here is the link for BlackArch Official MirrorLists https://github.com/BlackArch/blackarch-site/blob/master/blackarch-mirrorlist
14. Copy and paste this mirror list into /etc/pacman.d/blackarch-mirrorlist

### Regenerate keys and update
15. Now that you deleted all the corrupted keys, and pasted your own custom Mirrorlist into /etc/pacman.d/ you need to regenerate everything.
16. sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/*
17. sudo pacman-key --init && sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux blackarch && sudo pacman -Syy
18. sudo pacman -Syu
20. Everything should be working now. If you still have issues you will need to repeat the process and make sure you did not miss deleting any keys or mirrors that may
still have corruption.
21. Here are other commands you can run if you are still having issues. I did not need to run these to resolve my issue. I have also included helpful links at the bottom of this page.
22. sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring chaotic-keyring blackarch-keyring 
### pacman-key --refresh-keys (I don't think this command was useful at all)
### $ sudo pacman -Scc && pacman -Syyu

### Add mulitlib and AUR repos
23. To add multilib repo it is a simple uncomment in /etc/pacman.conf where it says include.
24. Also check mirrorlist and blackarch-mirrorlist are un-commented as well.
25. To add the AUR you need an AUR package manager like Paru. It is my favorite. Written in Rust
26. You need a rust stable version. 
27. sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
28. git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
29. cd paru
30. makepkg -si
31. Lookup a package in the AUR with Paru : $ paru -Ss package_name
32 Install package with paru : $ paru -S package_name.
38. Done below you will find resource links.
