If you have ever encountered the "Levon noptrix kayan bug" then this may help you fix it. 
This bug is so old yet it still has not been fixed. I am not sure what causes the bug. It is 
either a bad timezone or a corrupt mirrorlist. Here are the steps to fix it. This is for 
educational purposes. If you break your machine it is not my fault. I would classify this 
an easy fix once the issue is understood.

### Delete any corruptions.
> Fix your time
> # timectl set-ntp true
> Delete all the corrupted keys or mirrorlists. Yes, I said delete all your mirrorlists. If you do not feel
comfortable doing this then don't. Do more research and or follow other guides on this. There are many other resource links
about this bug. I have linked some of them below.
> Make backups of your current mirrorlist, blackarch-mirrorlist
> sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist (also blackarch-mirrorlist and mirrorlist.pacnew as well)
> sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/blackarch-mirrorlist
> sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.pacnew
> sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/hooks/*
> sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/scripts/*
> sudo rm -rf ~/.gnupg
> root@arch# rm -rf -R /root/.gnupg
> sudo rm -rf -R /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/ (Delete everything in the directory even the gnupg/ folder itself if possible)
> sudo rm -rf -R /var/lib/pacman/sync/blackarch.db.sig (I also recommend just deleting everything inside the sync folder)
> sudo rm -rf -R /var/lib/pacman/sync/* (Optional but if your issue is persistant delete everything in the sync folder)

### Create your own MirrorList
> Now you need to create a custom mirrorlist. (https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist) This is an important step because this "bug" will keep pointing to the wrong mirrors
so it is highley recommended  you create your own custom mirror list. See the links below to create your own arch and or blackarch mirror list.
>  Once you create your custom mirror list clean it
> $ sed -i "s/#Serv/Serv/g" mirrorlist (Your just replacing #Serv with Serve to remove the hashtag from the word server)
>  Or you can do $ sudo cat updated_mirrors.txt | sed "s/#Serv/Serv/g" > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
> Basically just the updated mirrorlist to /etc/pacmand.d/mirrorlist (You will want servers that are in your country. Just a recommendation.)
> Do the same thing for the blackarch-mirrorlist, but I do not think they have a custom mirrorlist generator like arch does. There is this package called reflector.
You can look into that further at https://joshtronic.com/automatically-update-arch-linux-mirrors/
> Here is the link for BlackArch Official MirrorLists https://github.com/BlackArch/blackarch-site/blob/master/blackarch-mirrorlist
> Copy and paste this mirror list into /etc/pacman.d/blackarch-mirrorlist

### Regenerate keys and update
> Now that you deleted all the corrupted keys, and pasted your own custom Mirrorlist into /etc/pacman.d/ you need to regenerate everything.
> sudo rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/gnupg/*
> sudo pacman-key --init && sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux blackarch && sudo pacman -Syy
> sudo pacman -Syu
> Everything should be working now. If you still have issues you will need to repeat the process and make sure you did not miss deleting any keys or mirrors that may
still have corruption.
> Here are other commands you can run if you are still having issues. I did not need to run these to resolve my issue. I have also included helpful links at the bottom of this page.
> sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring chaotic-keyring blackarch-keyring 
> pacman-key --refresh-keys (This can take an hour or more so if you refresh your keys be patient for it to finish)
> $ sudo pacman -Scc 
> $ sudo pacman -Syyu

### Add mulitlib and AUR repos
> To add multilib repo it is a simple uncomment in /etc/pacman.conf where it says include.
> Also check mirrorlist and blackarch-mirrorlist are un-commented as well.
> To add the AUR you need an AUR package manager like Paru. It is my favorite. Written in Rust
> You need a rust stable version. 
> sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel
> git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
> cd paru
> makepkg -si
> Lookup a package in the AUR with Paru : $ paru -Ss package_name
> Install package with paru : $ paru -S package_name.
> Done below you will find resource links.

### STRAP.SH
### Re-enable BlackArch Repo with strap.sh
> If you had this issue and your BlackArch repo stopped working up when you query with pacman or your favorite AUR pkg manager then
you can fix it with strap.sh
> I actually recommend the following link as it is easier to follow. 
> https://www.makeuseof.com/install-blackarch-tools-on-arch-linux/
> Or just following the guide on https://www.blackarch.org/downloads.html
> I do not think I could explain it any easier than how it is explained on the sites above regarding strap.sh.
> curl the strap.sh file compare the sha1sum hash to the one on the link above give it +x executable permissions, 
run it and then just do a regular update with sudo pacman -Syu.
> root@arch# curl -O https://blackarch.org/strap.sh
> root@arch# sha1sum strap.sh
> verify the sha1sum with the website above.
> run strap.sh
>  give it executable permission chmod +x strap.sh
> root@arch# ./strap.sh
> install something from the blackarch repo to make sure it works
> sudo pacman -S metasploit  (for example)
> enable the includes in your /etc/pacman.conf and or /etc/pacman.conf.pacnew file.
> Why pacnew file extension? Because pacnew is just pacman's way to update the config 
and let you know it is the updated config and not the original. Basically just enable the 
includes in both configs just to be sure.
> sudo pacman -Syu
> I had much trouble with strap.sh and getting blackarch-mirrorlist to show up in my pacman/yay/paru querries. I am still trying to figure out
why BlackArch tools are not showing up. Once I figure it I will update this part of the walk through with strap.sh.
> Done.
