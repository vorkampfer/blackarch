# BlackArch scrpts, tips, tricks, links, and guides I created to help people who are new to BlackArch become powerusers.
1. Here are some tips to help you to become a power user on BlackArch, and hopefully save you some time.
2. Click [HERE](https://github.com/vorkampfer/blackarch/blob/main/levon_noptrix_kayan_bug) to see the levon noptrix kayan bug fix.
3. The Levon Noptrix Kayan bug is also called the invalid signature bug or signature unknown trust issue.
4. There is an ext4 data corruption that effects Linux Kernel 6.1.64-1.Found in version linux/6.1.64-1.
Fixed in version linux/6.1.66-1. See more about it from [YouTube ChrisTitus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCSjpegO5Sk). Here is the main article from debian.org [here](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1057843). 
5. I upload the ssh_user_enum.py script. You can download it from searchsploit. searchsploit -m linux/remote/45939.py It only ran as python2, but I edited it so it runs with python3. I also added a cheesy banner. This script is good for trying to enumerate SSH users on a linux machine. I think it requiers a certain SSH version. I thought it was a cool little python enumeration script so I am sharing.
